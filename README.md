Wish there was a way to import Sass files as easily as CSS files? Now there is!

Introducing eleventy-load, an [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) plugin which resolves dependencies and post-processes files for you. Loading Sass files is just one example: eleventy-load exposes 'loaders' which can process **any file** including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images and more. The concept of eleventy-load is very similar to [webpack loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/), albeit with infinitely less JavaScript sent to the browser.
